# 01 - DATA ENGINEER
Let's start this series with two great posts by  Maxime Beauchemin.

In  the first one Maxime  attempts to define data engineering and described how this new role relates to historical and modern roles in the data space. 

In the second one, reported in the comments, Maxime concentrates instead on the challenges and risks that cripple data engineers and enumerates the forces that work against this discipline as it goes through its adolescence.
